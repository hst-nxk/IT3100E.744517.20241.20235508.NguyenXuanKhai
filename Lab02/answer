1,When should accessor methods be used?
-We only use getters/setters if it absolutely necessary. If we have other ways to control the object, we should not use them
since these methods expose information about how a class is implemented and as a consequence make your code harder to maintain.
Only little bit of change can make our code many compile errors.


2, If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
-Yes, Java allows to use multiple of constructors in a class with different parameters lists satisfies characteristics of an particular object
due to the feature named "constructor overloading".
